# Crypto-Suite

This repository contains a basic C++ module for RSA encryption/decryption.
The utilities implemented are: 
* Random prime number generation
* Inverse modulo computation
* RSA key generation
* RSA encrytion using public key
* RSA decryption using private key
* Baby-Step Giant-Step algorithm for solvinf discrete logarithm
